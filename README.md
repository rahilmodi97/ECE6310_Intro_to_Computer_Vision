This repository will contain all the labs which I have done throughout the course.

* Lab1 - Convolution and timing.
In this lab we used different convolution methods to smoothen a given image with the help of 7x7 kernel. It involved smoothing by a standard 7x7 kernal, separable filters 
which involved horizontal (1x7) and vertical (7x1) filters and the last part involved separable filters with sliding window. We also performed time comparison between all the 3
methods to determine which was the fastest method.
